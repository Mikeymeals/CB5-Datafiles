    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Trust Aura</Name>
      <Text>Totivillus projects a 25-foot-radius trust aura. As long as Totivillus is talking, creatures in that area find his utterances so fascinating and compelling that they must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns; if the saving throw fails, they can't attack Totivillus directly until the start of their next turn. This effect ends immediately and can't be renewed for 1 minute if Totivillus attacks physically. Devils are not immune to this aura.</Text>

    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Devil's Mark</Name>
      <Text>Totivillus sprays magical ink from his fingertips at a single target within 30 feet. The target must make a successful DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or receive a devil's mark: a tattoo in the shape of Totivillus's personal seal. All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil.marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed by remove curse if the caster also makes a successful DC 23 spellcasting check. The mark reveals itself as desecrated to detect evil and good. It often shifts its position on the body, especially when it's concealed (and usually at the most inconvenient moment). Because such marks are sometimes placed on those who've made pacts with devils, NPC paladins and clerics might assume that any character bearing a devil's mark is in league with evil forces.</Text>
