    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Plague of Ill Omen</Name>
      <Text>The rat king radiates a magical aura of misfortune in a 30-foot radius. A foe of the rat king that starts its turn in the aura must make a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be cursed with bad luck until the start of its next turn. When a cursed character makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it must subtract 1d4 from the result.</Text>

    </MonsterTrait>
    <MonsterAction>
      <Name>Bite</Name>
      <Text>Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and a bitten creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease. A diseased creature gains one level of exhaustion immediately. When the creature finishes a long rest, it must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains another level of exhaustion. On a success, the disease does not progress. The creature recovers from the disease if its saving throw succeeds after two consecutive long rests or if it receives a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic. The creature then recovers from one level of exhaustion after each long rest.</Text>
