      <Name>The Queen of Night and Magic's Lair</Name>
      <Text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Night and Magic takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Queen of Night and Magic can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- The Queen wills darkness to overpower the light. All bright light sources in the lair shed only dim light to their normal bright light radius, and dim light sources are extinguished. This lasts until the Queen dismisses the effect or dies.
- An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. Creatures in the wall’s space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semimaterial shadow resists intrusion. For every foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, any creature that, during its own turn, occupies any part of the wall’s space takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, or until she dies.
- The Queen targets one creature within 60 feet of her and assails its mind with visions of hopelessness and despair. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 on the next round.</Text>
    </MonsterTrait>
    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Regional Effects</Name>
      <Text>The region containing the Queen of Night and Magic’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen’s lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause any relevant die roll to be made with disadvantage.
- Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing minor random effects similar to a prestidigitation cantrip.
- The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair, similar to a clairvoyance spell.
While the Summer Court rules, the regional effects of the Queen’s lair extend into the Winter Palace, but they are diminished and weaker than normal. During the Winter Court’s reign, the Winter Palace is not subject to the regional effects. If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair gradually return to normal over the course of 2d10 days.</Text>

      <Name>Shadow Rift (Recharge 5-6)</Name>

Any creature within the rift takes 72 (16d8) cold damage, or half damage with a successful DC 23 Constitution saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw are also restrained by icy wisps of shadow. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the restrained condition on a success.</Text>
