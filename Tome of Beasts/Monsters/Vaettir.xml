      <Text>Corpse-black vaettir can see the face of any creature holding or carrying any item the vaettir ever claimed as its own. It also detects the direction and distance to items it ever owned, so long as that item is currently owned by another. If the item changes hands, the new owner becomes the target of the vaettir's hunt. Bone-white vaettir see individuals who have offended them. Neither time nor distance affects these abilities, so long as both parties are on the same plane.</Text>
