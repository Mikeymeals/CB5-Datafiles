    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Orders to Attack (1/Day)</Name>
      <Text>Each creature of the city watch captain's choice that is within 30 feet of it and can hear it makes one melee or ranged weapon attack as a reaction. This person could easily have been on the other side of the law, but he likes the way he looks in the city watch uniform.and the way city residents look at him when he walks down the street leading a patrol. With a long mustache and a jaunty cap, there's no denying that he cuts a rakishly handsome figure. While a trained investigator, the city watch captain is not afraid to draw his blade to end a threat to his city.</Text>
