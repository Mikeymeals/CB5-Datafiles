      <Name>Immutable Form</Name>

    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Serpentine Armlets</Name>
      <Text>As a bonus action, the shabti commands its armlets to drop to the floor, whereupon they become two giant poisonous snakes. The shabti can mentally direct the serpents (this does not require an action). If the snakes are killed, they dissolve into wisps of smoke which reform around the shabti's forearms, and they can't be turned into snakes for 1 week. These armlets are linked to the shabti at the time of its creation and do not function for other creatures.</Text>

    </MonsterTrait>
    <MonsterAction>
      <Name>Nabboot</Name>
      <Text>Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with tomb taint. The cursed target's speed is reduced to half, and its hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.</Text>
