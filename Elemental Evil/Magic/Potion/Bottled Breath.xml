      <Text>This bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.
If you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the gust of wind spell. If you hold the breath, you don’t need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn’t give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.</Text>
