      <Name>Castes and Colors</Name>
      <Text>Grung society is a caste system. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood.
Green grungs are the tribe's warriors, hunters, and laborers. Blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders. (Use the grung stat block to represent members of the green, blue, and purple castes.)
Red grungs are the tribe's scholars and spellcasters, and they are superior to purple. blue, and green grungs. (Use the grung wildling stat block to represent members of the red caste.)
Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions. A tribe's sovereign is always a gold grung. (Use the grung elite warrior stat block to represent members of the orange and gold castes.)</Text>
