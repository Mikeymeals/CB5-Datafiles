  <Name>Vegepygmy Chief</Name>
  <Descriptions />
  <Description>Vegepygmies, also called mold folk or moldies, are fungus creatures that inhabit dark areas that are warm and wet, including underground caves and dense forests where little sunlight penetrates. Although they prefer to eat fresh meat, bone, and blood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soil and many forms of organic matter, meaning that they rarely go hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss and make other noises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can't speak in a conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies communicate by hissing, gestures, and rhythmic tapping on the body.
Vegepygmies build and craft little; any gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built by copying simple construction they have witnessed.
As a vegepygmy ages, it grows tougher and develops spore clusters on its body. Spore-bearing vegepygmies become chiefs. A vegepygmy chief can expel its spores in a burst, infecting nearby creatures.</Description>

      <Name>Spores (1/Day)</Name>
      <Text>A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isnâ€™t a plant must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</Text>
