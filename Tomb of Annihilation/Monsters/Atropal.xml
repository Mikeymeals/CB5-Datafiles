    <Description>
      <Name>Negative Energy Connection</Name>
      <Text>The shriveled umbilical cord of an atropal appears to trail off into nothingness. but in fact, it attaches to the Negative Plane. This connection gives the atropal power over death and undeath. The cord can be severed by a vorpals  ord or other vorpal weapon, and doing so weakens the atropal's tie to the Negative Plane.
An atropal can summon vestiges of creatures that died in the Negative Plane, which manifest as wraiths. These servants can exist outside the Negative Plane only by the atropal's sheer force of will, and they quickly dissipate when the atropal is destroyed.</Text>

  </Descriptions>
  <Description>An atropal is a ghastly, unfinished creation of an evil god, cast adrift and abandoned long ago. Since an atropal was never truly alive, it can't be raised from the dead or resurrected by any means. Even divine intervention can't breathe true life into this hateful, miserable horror. An atropal is malformed and unfinished. Its wet, wrinkled, and bloated body is surmounted by a hairless, overlarge head set with glassy, vacant eyes. It constantly drools stinking ichor as it mouths obscenities. Its arms are too slender, with tiny hands ending in cruelly shaped nails. An atropal never walks but always floats, with its atrophied, dead legs hanging useless below it.</Description>
