  <Descriptions>
    <Description>
      <Name>Strange Collection</Name>
      <Text>Ras Nsi has a sizable collection of apparel and accouterments from distant lands, most of which were taken from dead explorers. The collection includes a fine Cormyrean cloak, a Sembian wine flask, and a bejeweled Amnian doublet and matching money pouch. He also bears a flame tongue longsword.

      <Name>Slow Death</Name>
      <Text>Ras Nsi has died and been brought back from the dead more than once. Consequently, he is suffering from the effects of the Soulmonger's death curse. His hit point maximum has been reduced, and leprous wounds cover his flesh. In a fitting irony, Ras Nsi is unaware that Acererak is the cause of the curse, for neither he nor the yuan-ti are aware of what lies within the Tomb of the Nine Gods, other than the dead gods for which it is named. If the characters can make him understand that their efforts will help him, Ras Nsi might be tempted not to stand in their way.

  <Description>The word "ras" is a noble title akin to "duke." Ras Nsi was once a Chultan paladin, a Chosen of Ubtao and sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished from the city. Becoming a vengeful warlord, Ras Nsi attempted to conquer Mezro with an undead army but was defeated. Rather than seek redemption, he sought revenge and was stripped of his god-given powers. The undead horde, no longer under his control, spread throughout the jungles of Chult.
Withdrawing to Omu, Nsi clung to his noble title, joined forces with the yuan-ti living there, and underwent a horrible ritual to become a powerful yuan-ti malison—retaining his human head and torso and gaining a serpentine lower body. With Ubtao gone from the world, Ras Nsi and his new yuan-ti followers began searching for a way to bring forth Dendar the Night Serpent. Acererak has promised to help this effort, in exchange for Ras Nsi's pledge to defend the Tomb of the Nine Gods. In truth, Acererak has no intention of honoring his bargain, and Ras Nsi is beginning to suspect as much.</Description>
