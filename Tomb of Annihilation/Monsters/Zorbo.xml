  <Descriptions />
  <Description>A zorbo (pronounced ZOR-boh) is a ferocious omnivore similar in size and appearance to a koala. Living in trees and caves, it has long claws, a dour disposition, and a fondness for humanoid flesh. A zorbo alters its natural armor to match its surroundings, and it can weaken and destroy armor, shields, and protective magic items with its sharp claws.</Description>

      <Name>Natural Armor</Name>
      <Text> The zorbo magically absorbs the natural strength of its surroundings, adjusting its Armor Class based on the material it is standing or climbing on: AC 15 for wood or bone, AC 17 for earth or stone, or AC 19 for metal. If the zorbo isn't in contact with any of these substances, its AC is 10.</Text>

      <Name>Destructive Claws</Name>
      <Text> Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:8 (2d6 + 1) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature wearing armor, carrying a shield, or in possession of a magic item that improves its AC, it must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one such item worn or carried by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +1 bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed.</Text>
