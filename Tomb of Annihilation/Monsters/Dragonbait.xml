      <Name>An Unexpected Friendship</Name>
      <Text>Dragonbait met Artus Cimber in Port Nyanzaru, and the two became fast friends. As Artus spoke of his quest to reunite with his wife, Alisanda, he was comforted by Dragonbait's quiet manner and unusual methods of communication. With a smile and a nod, Dragonbait agreed to help Artus. A frequent visitor to Chult, the saurial understood the dangers of the jungle all too well.</Text>

  <Description>Dragonbait is a champion of good and a saurial- a race that originated on a distant world and whose members have long lives. Very few saurials dwell in the Forgotten Realms, and no saurial communities are believed to exist anywhere in the world.
The saurial's language is a combination of dicks and whistles beyond the human range of hearing. so Dragonbait tends to rely on scents to communicate emotions. To be understood by most speaking creatures, he must "shout" a scent. Dragonbait's known scents include: brimstone (confusion), roses (sadness), lemon (pleasure or joy), baked bread (anger), violets (danger or fear), honeysuckle (tenderness or concern), wood smoke (devotion
or piety), tar (victory or celebration). and ham (nervousness or worry).
Dragonbait stands 4 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 150 pounds, and has a dry, wrinkled hide. He wields a holy avenger longsword and carries a blue, red, and white shield. Though he has traits in common with paladins, Dragonbait isn't a member of any class. Using an ability known as the Shen-state, he can determine the alignment of any creature within 60 feet of him.</Description>
