      <Name>Dragonmark</Name>
      <Text>You have a magical mark that indicates you are a member of one of the dragonmarked houses. Select one of the options from the Dragonmarks table.
You gain the ability to innately cast spells and cantrips, as summarized in the Dragonmark Benefits table, using the spellcasting ability listed under the Ability column. You cast each spell at its lowest level. Once you cast a given spell this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it innately again. You must still expend any material components. Your dragonmark confers the following benefits:
• When you first take this feat, you gain the least dragonmark. You learn the spells listed under the Least column.
• At 5th level and higher, your mark becomes more potent, improving to lesser dragonmark. You also learn the spell listed under the Lesser column.
• At 9th level and higher, your mark’s power increases again, becoming a greater dragonmark. You also learn the spell listed under the Greater column.
