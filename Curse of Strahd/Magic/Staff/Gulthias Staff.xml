      <Name>Gulthias Staff</Name>
      <Text>Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry in the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staﬀ is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staﬀ has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk. If the staﬀ is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.</Text>

      <Text>The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be inflicted with short-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 · of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</Text>
