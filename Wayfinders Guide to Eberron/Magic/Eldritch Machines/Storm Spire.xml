      <Text>While you are within 5 feet of the spire, you can cast control weather as a ten-minute ritual. This allows you to pick a point within 100 miles of the spire and influence the weather within a 10-mile radius of that point. Maintaining this effect require concentration.
You can also use an action to influence the weather within a ten-mile radius of the spire itself; you don’t have to use concentration to maintain this effect, and you can sustain this at the same time that you’re manipulating distant weather.

  <Name>Storm Spire</Name>
  <Description>This eldritch machine is a form of dragonmark focus item; you must have the Greater Mark of Storms to attune to this device. Storm spires allow House Lyrandar to influence the weather, which can be a boon for the local population or a curse if the Lyrandar baron chooses to demand payment for desired conditions. You gain the following benefits while you are attuned to a storm spuire:
• You can sense weather patterns within a 100-mile radius of the spire and accurately predict the weather for up to 24 hours.
• While you are within 60 feet of the spire, you can use an action to cast any of the following spells: call lightning, gust of wind. You cast these as 5th level spells, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability.
• While you are within 5 feet of the spire, you can cast control weather as a ten-minute ritual. This allows you to pick a point within 100 miles of the spire and influence the weather within a 10-mile radius of that point. Maintaining this effect require concentration.
• You can also use an action to influence the weather within a ten-mile radius of the spire itself; you don’t have to use concentration to maintain this effect, and you can sustain this at the same time that you’re manipulating distant weather.</Description>
