  <Name>Master's Call</Name>
  <Description>While this looks like a scrap heap assembled from shattered constructs and wreckage from the Mournland, this eldritch machine possesses tremendous power. You gain the following benefits while you are attuned to the master’s call and within one mile of the device.
• You can sense the presence and location of all warforged within ten miles.
• You have advantage on any Charisma-based check made against a warforged.
• While you are in contact with the master’s call, you can use an action to target a warforged within ten miles of the device. You can send a telepathic message of up to 25 words to the target. They must make a Wisdom saving throw, with a difficulty of 14 + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target is affected by a suggestion compelling them to follow your command. This effect doesn’t require concentration; it lasts for eight hours, until you choose to end it, or until the victim successfully fulfils the command, whichever comes first. You can control up to eight warforged at once using this effect.</Description>
