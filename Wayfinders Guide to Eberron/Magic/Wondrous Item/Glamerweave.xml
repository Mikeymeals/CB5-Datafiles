  <Name>Glamerweave</Name>
  <Description>Glamerweave clothing is imbued with cosmetic illusions. Traditionally, these patterns are contained within the cloth, but higher-end glamerweave can have more dramatic effects. You could have a gown that appears to be wreathed in flames, or a ahat thatâ€™s obited by illusory butterflies. Regardless of the design, these are cosmetic effects and have no impact on combat.</Description>
