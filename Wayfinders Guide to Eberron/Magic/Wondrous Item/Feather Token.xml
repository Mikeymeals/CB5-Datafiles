  <Name>Feather Token</Name>
  <Description>This small metal disk is inscribed with the image of a feather. While the token is in your possession, you can cast feather fall as a bonus action. A feather token holds sufficient charge for a single use, after which it loses its power. While itâ€™s an expensive form of insurance, frequent airship travelers and citizens of Sharn often appreciate the security it provides.</Description>
