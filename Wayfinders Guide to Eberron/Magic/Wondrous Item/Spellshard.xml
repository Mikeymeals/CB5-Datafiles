  <Name>Spellshard</Name>
  <Description>A spellshard a polished Eberron dragonshard, sized to fit into the palm of a hand. The shard is imbued with a particular work of literature. By holding the shard and concentrating, you can see its pages in your mind’s eye. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic will draw you to the first section that addreses it, and a simple ritual allows you to add content to the shard.
An arcane caster can use a spellshard instead of a spellbook; the spellshard costs 1 gp per “page” in the shard, and otherwise functions as a mundane spellbook. Spellshards can also be used as diaries or journals. More advanced (and uncommon) shards can require a particular mental passphrase to access the contents of the shard.</Description>
