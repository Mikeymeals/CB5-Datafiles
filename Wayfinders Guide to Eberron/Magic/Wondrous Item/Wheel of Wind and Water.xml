  <Name>Wheel of Wind and Water</Name>
  <Description>When mounted at the helm of an elemental galleon or airship, this allows a character who possesses the Mark of Storm to telepathically control the elemental bound into the vessel. If a wheel of wind and water is mounted on a mundane sailing ship, a character with the Mark of Storm can create an area of ideal conditions around the vessel, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour.</Description>
