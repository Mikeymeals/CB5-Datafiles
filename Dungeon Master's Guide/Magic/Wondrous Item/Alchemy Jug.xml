      <Name>Alchemy Jug</Name>
      <Text>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.

Acid — 8 ounces
Basic poison — 1/2 ounce
Beer — 4 gallons
Honey — 1 gallon
Mayonnaise — 2 gallons
Oil — 1 quart
