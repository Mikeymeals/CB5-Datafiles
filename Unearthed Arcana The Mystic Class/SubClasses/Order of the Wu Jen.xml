      <Text>Starting at 3rd level, when a creature’s resistance reduces the damage dealt by a psionic discipline of yours, you can spend 1 psi point to cause that use of the discipline to ignore the creature’s resistance. You can’t spend this point if doing so would increase the discipline’s cost above your psi limit.</Text>

  <Name>Order of the Wu Jen</Name>
  <SheetName>Wu Jen</SheetName>
  <Description>The Order of the Wu Jen features some of the most devoted mystics. These mystics seek to lock themselves away from the world, denying the limits of the physical world and replacing it with a reality that they create for themselves. Known as wu jens, these mystics cast their minds into the world, seize control of its fundamental principles, and rebuild it.
In practical terms, wu jens excel at controlling the forces of the natural world. They can hurl objects with their minds, control the four elements, and alter reality to fit their desires.</Description>
