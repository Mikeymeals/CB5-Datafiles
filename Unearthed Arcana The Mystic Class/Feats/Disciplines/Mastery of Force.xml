          <Name>Mastery of Force - Move (2–7 psi)</Name>
          <Text>Choose one object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature and that isn’t secured in place. It can’t be larger than 20 feet on a side, and its maximum weight depends on the psi points spent on this ability, as shown below.
As an action, you move the object up to 60 feet, and you must keep the object within sight during this movement. If the object ends this movement in the air, it falls. If the object would fall on a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take damage as listed on the table below.
Psi Spent: Maximum Weight  - Bludgeoning Damage 
2: 25 lbs. - 2d6
3: 50 lbs. - 4d6
5: 250 lbs. - 6d6
6: 500 lbs. - 7d6

          <Name>Mastery of Force - Grasp (3 psi; conc., 1 min.)</Name>
          <Text>You attempt to grasp a creature in telekinetic energy and hold it captive. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be grappled by you until your concentration ends or until the target leaves your reach, which is 60 feet for this grapple.
The grappled target can escape by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your psionic ability plus your proficiency bonus. When a target attempts to escape in this way, you can spend psi points to boost your check, abiding by your psi limit. You gain a +1 bonus per psi point spent.
While a target is grappled in this manner, you create one of the following effects as an action:</Text>
