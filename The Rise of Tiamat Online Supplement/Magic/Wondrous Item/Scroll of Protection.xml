      <Name>Scroll of Protection</Name>
      <Text>Each scroll of protection works against a specific type of creature.
Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in a invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-footradius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder.
The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends.
A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier</Text>
