      <Text>If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened shrub (see the Monster Manual for statistics) at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.
The awakened shrub is friendly toward you. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.</Text>
