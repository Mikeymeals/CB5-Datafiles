      <Text>You can transfer the opal's magic to a nonmagical item-a weapon or a suit of armor-by tracing the ild rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the opal is destroyed, and the rune appears in red on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:
Weapon. The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.
Armor. The armor is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. You have resistance to cold damage while wearing the armor.</Text>
