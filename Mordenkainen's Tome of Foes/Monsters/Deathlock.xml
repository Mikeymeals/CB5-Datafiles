  <Name>Deathlock</Name>
  <Descriptions>
    <Description>
      <Name>Obedient and Obsessed</Name>
      <Text>An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don’t please its patron fall away as its master’s desires become the purpose that drives the deathlock. The creature immediately resumes work on its patron’s behalf. Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock is forced to serve another powerful creature or might entail in gathering servants of its own.
Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron’s interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a great old one could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world.</Text>

Great Old One patron: armor of Agathys, detect thoughts, dissonant whispers, hunger of Hadar, Tasha's hideous laughter, phantasmal force</Text>

  <Description>The forging of a pact between a Warlock and a patron is no minor occasion—at least not for the warlock⁠. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock⁠ who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul Undead driven to serve its Otherworldly Patron from beyond the grave.
An extraordinarily powerful Necromancer might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock’s patron.
