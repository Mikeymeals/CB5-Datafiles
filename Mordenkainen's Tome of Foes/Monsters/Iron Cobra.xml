      <Name>Clockworks</Name>
      <Text>The gnomes’ efforts to invent and tinker with magic and mechanical devices produce many failed constructs, but also result in genuine advances, such as clockworks. Since their discovery, the methods used to craft clockworks have passed from one community of gnomes to another and down the generations.
Constructed Nature. A clockwork doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      <Name>Individual Designs</Name>
      <Text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation⁠. A clockwork can be customized by adding clockwork enhancements.

  <Description>An iron cobra is exactly what its name implies: a metal snake with a poisonous bite. In addition to standard poisons, gnomes load this clockwork with alchemical concoctions that can paralyze creatures and cloud their minds with paranoia.</Description>
  <Flavour>Never depend on something built by a gnome. You can always rely on a gnome to take a good idea and make it impractical.

      <Text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect:
1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.
2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action⁠ to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it’s holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the dash action⁠, moving toward the nearest creature.
3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
