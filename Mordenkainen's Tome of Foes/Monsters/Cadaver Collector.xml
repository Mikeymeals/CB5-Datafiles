      <Text>Cadaver collectors respond to a summons from a mortal only when they are called to the scene of a great battle—either where one is in progress, where one is imminent, or where one once took place. They encase themselves in the armor and weapons⁠ of fallen warriors and impale the corpses of those warriors on the lances and other weapons⁠ embedded in their salvaged armor.</Text>

      <Text>Corpses that accumulate on the construct’s shell aren’t just grisly battle trophies. A cadaver collector can summon the spirits of these cadavers to join battle with its enemies and to paralyze more creatures for eventual impalement. Although these specters are individually weak, a cadaver collector can call up an almost endless supply of them, if given time.</Text>

  <Description>The ancient war machines known as cadaver collectors lumber aimlessly across the blasted plains of Acheron until they are called upon by a necromancer, hobgoblin general, or other evil warlord to bolster the ranks of a conquering army. These fearsome constructs obey their summoners until being dismissed back to Acheron, but if a summoner comes to a bad end, a cadaver collector might wander the material plane for centuries, collecting corpses while searching for a way to return home.</Description>
  <Flavour>Cadaver collectors cannot summon specters of those they have not slain, nor will slain specters return to one. Starve it of victims, and then do not attack⁠ until you can be sure you’ll destroy it. Meteor swarm⁠ works well.
