      <Name>Bloodlust</Name>
      <Text>Bulezaus crave violence. Their eagerness to kill and willingness to die make them common members of any demon lord’s entourage. When not being corralled by larger and tougher demons, bulezaus gather into scrabbling mobs, wrestling and fighting among themselves until a better target comes along or until a stronger demon bullies them into subservience.</Text>

      <Name>Repulsive</Name>
      <Text>Disfiguring ailments plague bulezaus: crusted eyes, maggots wriggling in open sores, and a reek of rotten meat that follows them wherever they go.</Text>
    </Description>
  </Descriptions>
  <Description>Diseased manifestations of animalistic rage, bulezaus embody the violence of nature. Across the Abyss, bulezaus lurk in deep canyons and lofty crags, and many find a place in the ranks of the demon lords’ armies, serving as foot soldiers in the Abyss’s endless warring.</Description>

  <Actions>
    <MonsterAction>
      <Name>Barbed Tail</Name>
      <Text>Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d12 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease ends. While poisoned⁠ in this way, the target sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target’s hit point maximum is reduced by 4 (1d8). The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</Text>
