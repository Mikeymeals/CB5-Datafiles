      <Name>Keepers of Forbidden Lore⁠</Name>
      <Text>Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoarding knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would advance their plans.</Text>

    <Description>
      <Name>Demon Crafters</Name>
      <Text>Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure that the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater strength⁠, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.</Text>

    <TableDescription>
      <Name>Variant: Flesh Warping</Name>
      <Text>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex’s Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.
A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.

  </Descriptions>
  <Description>Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abilities⁠ to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex’s body. Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the landscape becomes polluted.
</Description>
  <Flavour>No creature embodies the chaotic nature of the Abyss so well as the sibriex. Although the realm of the demons is already a place of infinite horrors, sibriexes for some reason make even more of these monstrosities⁠.

    </MonsterTrait>
    <MonsterTrait>
      <Name>Warp Creature</Name>
      <Text>The sibriex targets⁠ up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex’s Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison⁠ removes any levels of exhaustion⁠ caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion⁠. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion⁠, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex’s control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.</Text>
