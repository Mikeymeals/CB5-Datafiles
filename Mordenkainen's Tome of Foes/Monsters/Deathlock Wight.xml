    <Description>
      <Name>Deathlock⁠</Name>
      <Text>The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasion—at least not for the warlock⁠. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock⁠ who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave.
An extraordinarily powerful necromancer might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock’s patron.</Text>

    <Description>
      <Name>Obedient and Obsessed</Name>
      <Text>An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don’t please its patron fall away as its master’s desires become the purpose that drives the deathlock⁠⁠. The creature immediately resumes work on its patron’s behalf. Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock⁠⁠ is forced to serve another powerful creature or might entail in gathering servants of its own.
Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron’s interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a great old one could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world.</Text>

  <Description>Bereft of much of its magic, a deathlock wight lingers between the warlock it was and the deathly existence of a wight—a special⁠ punishment meted out by certain patrons and necromancers.</Description>

      <Name>Life Drain</Name>
      <Text>Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.
