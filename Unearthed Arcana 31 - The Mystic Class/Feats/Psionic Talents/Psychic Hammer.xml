      <Text>As an action, you try to grasp one creature you can see within 120 feet of you, with a hand crafted from telekinetic energy. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. If it takes any of this damage and is Large or smaller, you can move it up to 10 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice. You can’t lift the target off the ground unless it is already airborne or underwater.
The talent’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</Text>
