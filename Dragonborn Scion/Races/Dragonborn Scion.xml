"Nowhere else to run, you scaly runt." laughed Garush. "No magic, no weapon, no fire. Nothing left to do but die."
Vellath, transfixed on sword, faintly heard leaves rustling against the wind. She flashed a grin. "Actually, I think I'll try something clever instead." she said, and threw herself flat on the ground, distracting Garush from the sound of her clanmates drawing their bows from the trees.</Flavour>

      <Name>Noble and Contemplative</Name>
      <Text>A scion is unmistakably related to their older brethren, the dragonborn, and yet are undeniably different. These dragonkin share their humanoid form and upright stance as well as their hardened scales, sharp claws and teeth, but physically they can differ greatly. Scions are smaller in stature, roughly on par with humans, averaging around 6 feet tall, weighing around 200 pounds or more. Where a dragonborn is large and physically imposing, a scion is wiry and holds an almost royal bearing about them. 
Created from the rituals and sorcery of ancient metallic dragons, scions were formed to possess not the physical might of dragons, but their mental prowess, their wisdom, and imposing strength of spirit. These ancient dragons saw fit to create a new generation of dragonborn, one that could champion good through character, not feats of strength. Being more recently added to the world, a scion's original draconic heritage runs more strongly, expressed through distinct metallic scales ranging from brass to gold, crests and horns and tails. A scion holds themself with poise and dignity, but is always susceptible to moments of pride or greed. Despite their good tendencies and noble pursuits, it is not unusual for a scion to keep a small collection of shiny baubles from their travels.

      <Name>Inherited Mantles</Name>
      <Text>Born with strength of mind and spirit, scions were given a share of metallic purpose. The progeny of the Good Dragons are forged out of the drive to better serve the world. They were sent into the world with a duty to serve the greater good, and many find deep fulfillment in achieving this in their own way, be it protecting the weak as a righteous paladin, performing government duties as an ambassador, or tending to a long forgotten forest.
This sense of duty extends to a scion's clan as well. A scion's clan is a tightly woven community, composed of strong family units that often share duties amongst themselves. A clan may live in a self-sufficient settlement on the frontier, or they may be citizens of a bustling city. No matter where they planted their roots, the clan does its best to remain in sync with its environment. It is not out of the ordinary for the area around a homestead to prosper alongside them.
All the same, it is common for a scion to leave the clan once reaching adulthood, driven by wanderlust and a desire to experience the world. Some will strike out alone, but many will also enlist in military service, join an adventurer's guild, or even take up mercenary work when it suits their abilities.</Text>

      <Name>Distinct and Overshadowed</Name>
      <Text>Despite their differences, scions are often mistaken for dragonborn. This can be further perpetuated due to their significantly smaller population. Scions are the newer generation by several millennia have never held major territories by themselves and have not spent much time intentionally making names for themselves. Instead their communities are found spread out across the land, from small tribes in the wilderness to appointed positions on city councils. In fact, many scions even consider themselves dragonborn outright, and posit that distinguishing themselves as a wholly separate race misses the purpose to which they are called.
Still, many scions resent being considered the same as their older siblings and will take great strides in countering this. This drive can be known to override their creator's intended sense of purpose and can lead to acts of heroism made for selfish pursuits, or even acts of great evil.</Text>

      <Name>Scion Names</Name>
      <Text>Scions follow similar traditions as their dragonborn brethren for their chosen names. They are given personal names at birth, but place the name of their clan first, as is honorable. Additionally, some scions will be given additional names by their elders or clutchmates, to commemorate a great deed or notable trait. A scion never chooses these given names, but will wear them proudly.</Text>

      <Text>Scions are not usually found in the thick of physical combat. Instead, they find their calling in thoughtful pursuits, often as sorcerers, bards, or occasionally wizards.
Scion paladins are often of the bronze variety, strongly lead to fight evil whenever possible, and scion clerics pray to Bahamut for wisdom and guidance.
Scion druids and rangers are known to scout the wilderness, seeking bandits or those that would corrupt otherwise forgotten corners of the world.</Text>
