      <Text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. These warriors distract a foe you strike and hinder its attempts to harm your companions. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors. Until the start of your next turn or until your rage ends, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you, and creatures other than you have resistance to the damage of the target’s attacks.</Text>

      <Text>Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection for your allies. If you are raging and a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d8.
When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d8 at 10th level and by 4d8 at 14th level.</Text>

      <Name>Consult the Spirits</Name>
      <Text>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits and use them to scout far-off areas. When you do so, you cast the clairvoyance spell, without needing a spell slot. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, the spell invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for the spell.
After you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</Text>

      <Text>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to strike foes that dare to harm those you protect. When you use your Spirit Shield to protect a creature damaged by an attack, the attacker takes the same amount of damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.</Text>

  <Name>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</Name>
  <SheetName>Ancestral Guardian</SheetName>
  <Description>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid in a time of need.
Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</Description>
